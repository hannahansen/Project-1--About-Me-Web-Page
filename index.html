I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): I didn't realize how much I would enjoy creating a website, even a simple website. I was really stressed coming into it but after I started and everything was getting created I was blown away by how much fun this was and is. 
I could honestly see myself doing this in my spare time whenver I have some spare time. I did struggle a lot with the sizing of my photo but looked up how to do it and fixed it pretty quickly.

    <p>Ode to my co-worker, whose desk is too close to mine:</p>
    <pre>
The slurping man slurps
herba mate all day long
I crank my headphones

    <h2>Personal interests</h2>
    <p>I am really into anything outdoors. That goes for rock climbing, canyoneering, ultimate frisbee, running, basketball, snowboarding, and so much more. I find myself getting really invested into a sport for a few years. I never fully move on from any sport but once I start investing in another sport I do less of the prior sport.</p>
    <p>Something that always keeps me motivated in life is music. I love listening and playing as much music as I can. I've taught myself the piano and the guitar and am soon going to be learning the viola. If I could learn every instrument and invest all my time into them I would.</p>
    <p>Out of everything, there is nothing that is more important to me than family. My husband, my parents, my brothers, my sister-in-laws, my niece, and my nephews. To contradict myself a little from my last paragraph, if there way anything I could actually invest all my time into it would be my family. Nothing is more important than my family.</p>
